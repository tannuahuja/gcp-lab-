functions.cloudEvent('helloPubSub', cloudEvent => {
  // The Pub/Sub message is passed as the CloudEvent's data payload.
  const base64name = cloudEvent.data.message.data;

  const name = base64name
    ? Buffer.from(base64name, 'base64').toString()

gcloud functions deploy nodejs-pubsub-function \
  --gen2 \
  --runtime=nodejs20 \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --source=. \
  --entry-point=helloPubSub \
  --trigger-topic cf-demo \
  --stage-bucket qwiklabs-gcp-00-0059c431cf39-bucket \
  --service-account cloudfunctionsa@qwiklabs-gcp-00-0059c431cf39.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

```
gcloud functions describe nodejs-pubsub-function \
  --region=us-east1
```

#### task3 : test the function
