# Build an LLM and RAG-based Chat Application using AlloyDB and LangChain

One of the best tools for reducing Gen AI hallucinations is to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is the concept of retrieving some data or information, then augmenting your prompt used with your Large Language Model (LLM), which allows it to generate more accurate responses based on the data included in the prompt.

You'll also leverage the capabilities of AlloyDB AI, Google Cloud's database for AI-powered applications, and LangChain, a framework for developing applications, to connect the LLM to external data sources. By the end of this lab, you'll have a functional chat application that can intelligently answer questions by retrieving relevant information from your database.

What you'll learn
-How LLMs process language and how RAG enhances their capabilities by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base.
-Set up and interact with AlloyDB, a scalable and performant PostgreSQL database designed for demanding workloads.
- Explore LangChain's tools and components for building LLM-powered applications, including document loaders, prompt templates, and chains.
- Connect AlloyDB as a vector store with LangChain, allowing the chat application to access and retrieve relevant information for generating responses.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat application, allowing users to ask questions and receive informative answers.
