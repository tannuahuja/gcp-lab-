TravelBot Project Overview

Introduction:
TravelBot is a smart chatbot designed to help users find flights, book hotels, and get travel itineraries across India. It is built using Google Cloud Dialogflow CX and connects to real-time travel data through a webhook.

What TravelBot Can Do:

Greet Users – Says hello and starts the conversation.

Find Flights – Helps users search for flights by asking for the departure city, destination, and date.

Book Hotels – Finds available hotels based on location and stay dates.

Suggest Itineraries – Provides travel plans for different cities in India.

Live Data Access – Uses a webhook to fetch real-time travel details.

How It Works:

The user asks a question (e.g., "Find a flight from Delhi to Mumbai on March 10").

TravelBot understands the request and collects the required details.

The webhook sends a request to a travel API for live data.

The API returns the results (e.g., flight options, hotel availability, etc.).

TravelBot presents the best options to the user.

Setup Steps:

Upload the Chatbot Flow:

Use the travelbot_flow.json file and import it into Dialogflow CX.

Connect the Webhook:

TravelBot’s webhook is set up at:https://us-east4-l-ulti-tf-48hours-d55d.cloudfunctions.net/mytravelwebhook

Ensure webhook integration is enabled in Dialogflow CX.

Test the Bot:

Try different queries and check responses.

Example Conversations:

Flight Search:

User: "Find a flight from Delhi to Mumbai on March 10."

TravelBot: "Here are the available flights: Flight XYZ123 at 10 AM, Flight ABC456 at 3 PM."

Hotel Booking:

User: "Book a hotel in Goa from March 15 to March 20."

TravelBot: "Available hotels: Taj Exotica – ₹12,000 per night, Novotel Goa – ₹8,500 per night."

Itinerary Suggestion:

User: "Show me an itinerary for Kerala."

TravelBot: "Here's a suggested plan: Day 1 – Munnar sightseeing, Day 2 – Houseboat stay in Alleppey, Day 3 – Beach day at Kovalam."
