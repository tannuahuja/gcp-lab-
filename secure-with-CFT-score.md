Scenario
Imagine you are the Technical Lead of a 3 person team. Your remote teammates, Alice and Bob, are working very closely with you and deploying many resources into the same shared Google Cloud project as you. After a few weeks of working together, you start to notice a few red flags. You soon discover that both Alice and Bob have cut corners and introduced project configurations that you consider misconfiguration. One misconfiguration exposed a Cloud Storage bucket publicly. This is merely one misconfiguration that you have uncovered, but you fear that there could be many more.

After doing a quick Google search, you come across the Cloud Foundation Toolkit (CFT) Scorecard CLI utility. After a quick read, you decide this can help you administer policies into your Google Cloud environment and determine where misconfigurations are occurring. You decide to give it a try.
