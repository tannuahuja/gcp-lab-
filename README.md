Cymbal Group acquired the company in 1975 after it had been investing heavily in Cymbal Group's proprietary ATMs. As the bank grew into a national leader, they put strategic emphasis on modernizing the customer experience both in-person at their branches and digitally through an app they released in 2014. Cymbal Bank employs 42,000 people nationwide and, in 2019, reported $24 billion in revenue.
